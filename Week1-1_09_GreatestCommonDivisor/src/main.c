/*    Greatest Common Divisor (gcd)
a) Write a recursive function int gcd (int a, int b) that returns the greatest common divisor of 
two positive integers a and b.  Use the Euclidean algorithm:

            1. If a <b, exhange a and b
            2. Divide a by b and get the remainder r.
                If r = 0, report b as the GCD of a and b.
            3. Replace a by b and replace b by r.
                Return to previous step.

b) Write an iterative version of the algorithm as function gcd_iterative.
