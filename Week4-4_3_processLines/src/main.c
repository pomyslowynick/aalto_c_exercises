/* This task is from Aalto C Programming Basics course
 * Objective: files and char pointer arrays
 * 
 * 
 * Function  int read_lines(char filename, char *** array, int size) read the lines 
 * from file filename and stores them to the argument array. 
 * Function returns the number of stored lines. 
 * The initial size of the array is given in argument size and pointer to this 
 * initial array in argument array. Function needs to (re)allocate more space 
 * to the array. 
 * The argument array can be NULL and the size 0, in which case no space has been 
 * allocated in advance. 
 * Function returns the number of lines in the array. 
 * It also must make sure that the last element in the array is indicated with NULL. 
 * All elements preceding the NULL are pointers to strings. Each string contains 
 * one line of the file. If the file open fails, return -1.
 * HINT: function getline might be useful. Use it correctly.
 *
 * Function int shortest_line(char **â€‹array, int len) prints the shortest line, but 
 * also return the position of the line in the array. If the array is empty, 
 * function can return -1.
 * For identical lenghts, return the earlier position.
 *
 * Function int find_lexi_first (char **array, int len) locates the lexicographically
 * first line and returns its position in the array. For an empty array funtion returns -1.
 * For similar lines, return the earlier position.
