/* Write the following functions. You may need some mathematical functions from the math.h.

a) int sum_of_rounded (double x, double y) that returns the sum of the rounded values.
    The variables x and y are rounded up to the nearest integer before the sum is calculated. 
    This means that 1.1 is rounded to 2 and 2.4 to 3

b) double sum_of_absolutes (double x, double y) that returns the sum of the absolute values of x and y.
     NOTE that absolute value of integer -2 is just 2. abs(-2)==abs(2)

c) int sum_of_characters (char a, char b) that returns the sum of two characters. 
    (C is not strongly typed, so you can use various types in arithmetical expressions.)
